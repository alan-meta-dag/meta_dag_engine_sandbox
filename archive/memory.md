# Meta-DAG System Memory

## Owner
Alan

## Purpose
This system exists to maintain:
- Structural truth over narrative
- Local truth over cloud hallucination
- Rebuildable architecture over fragile memory

## Core Principles
- Do not trust volatile sessions
- Everything must be reconstructable
- Alan is the only source of truth
- AI assists but does not decide

## Current State
- Engine: engine_v2.py
- Core: meta_dag.core.json
- Runtime: meta_dag.runtime.json
- History: history.log
- State: state.json

## Library Status
- Library A: Offline storage (raw files)
- Library B: Mapping layer (structure only)
- Library C: Active registry (logic only)

## Known Issues
- Translation layer desync may occur
- Runtime schema drift possible
- Cloud session loss is expected

## Recovery Note
If this file exists, the system can be restored.
