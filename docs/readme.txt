Semantic Clarification – Governance Engine

This system does NOT implement AI self-governance.

All authority, rules and decision frameworks are:
- Human-defined
- Explicitly codified
- Mechanically enforced

The engine does NOT:
- Invent rules
- Modify governance logic autonomously
- Possess self-directed agency

The purpose of this system is:

To provide a deterministic execution framework
for human-defined standards and governance structures.

The engine acts as:
- An executor of defined logic
- A validator of structural integrity
- An audit trail generator

Final authority always remains with the human operator.
